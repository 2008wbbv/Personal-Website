	<h2>1. CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h2>
	<p>The CPU is the brain of the computer and performs all the calculations and processing tasks. The speed and performance of the CPU determine how fast the computer can run. The average price of a CPU varies depending on the brand, model, and speed, ranging from $50 to $1,000 or more.</p>

	<h2>2. Motherboard</h2>
	<p>The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all the components of the computer together. It houses the CPU, RAM, and other important components. The average price of a motherboard varies depending on the size, features, and brand, ranging from $50 to $500 or more.</p>

	<h2>3. RAM (Random Access Memory)</h2>
	<p>RAM is the temporary memory that the computer uses to store data that it needs to access quickly. The more RAM a computer has, the faster it can perform tasks. The average price of RAM varies depending on the size, speed, and brand, ranging from $20 to $200 or more.</p>

	<h2>4. Storage</h2>
	<p>There are two types of storage in a computer: Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and Solid State Drive (SSD). HDD is a traditional storage device that uses spinning disks to store data, while SSD uses flash memory to store data. SSDs are faster and more expensive than HDDs. The average price of storage varies depending on the size and type, ranging from $30 to $300 or more.</p>

	<h2>5. Graphics Card</h2>
	<p>A graphics card is responsible for rendering images and videos on the computer. It is essential for gaming, video editing, and other graphic-intensive tasks. The average price of a graphics card varies depending on the brand, model, and performance, ranging from $100 to $1,500 or more.</p>

	<h2>6. Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h2>
	<p>The PSU is responsible for providing power to all the components in the computer. It is essential to choose a PSU that can provide enough power to all the components in the computer. The average price of a PSU varies depending on the power output and brand, ranging from $30 to $300 or more.</p>

	<h2>7. Case</h2>
	<p>The case is the outer shell that houses all the components in the computer. It is important to choose a case that can accommodate all the components and has proper ventilation to prevent overheating. The average price of a case varies depending on the size, features, and brand, ranging from $30 to $200 or more.</p>

	<p>In conclusion, building a computer can be a fun and rewarding experience, but it requires a basic understanding of the various components that make up a computer. The prices of the components vary depending on the brand, model, and performance, but having a budget in mind can
